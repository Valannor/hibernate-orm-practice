**Hibernate and JPA practice**

Project created for consolidation of knowledge in JPA frameworks.
The idea is to create simple CRUD application using xml and annotation configuration of JPA context.
Although implementation has to include Criteria, SQL and HQL queries.

For more simplicity, I decided to use H2 Database server, which was downloaded by following link:
